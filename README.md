# Create React Hook App

I tried to create a simple notebook page with React Hook(useState, useEffect, useRef), it provides such as connect API, insert, delete item feature, have fun :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

I use the server side with json-server, all data save in db.json, you have to run server separately [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Port 3000 is already from json-server occupied, so you can only open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
